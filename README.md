<h1 style="align: center;">Team Profile Generator 👋</h1>

## Description
🔍 Welcome to my homework repository, which I have generated under the guidance and acceptance criteria of the University of Birmingam! This repository contains the application designed for generating a HTML webpage for an organisation that wishes to keep record of all their employees, hence, the name "Team Profile Generator". This application uses Node.js to add team members and thier information to the organisation webpage, to appear in the browser. The owner of this application may add as many team members onto the webpage as they desire, depending on how many employees work at the organisation, including managers, engineers, and interns. This application makes it very convenient for team managers and organisers to keep track of all the members in their team, along with their credentials and other necessary information.

## Installation
💾 In order to install this app, the user must have access to all the necessary software applications and modules installed/created on their machines, including the following: 
- Node.js 
- package.json 
- fs 
- inquirer 
- All files in the './library' directory. 

## Instructions
⚙️ After installing/creating all the necessary modules, the user must start the application by opening the local terminal and typing "node index.js". Then, the user will be prompted with a series of prompts, to which the user must respond with appropriate answers. The server prompts the user with questions confirming the following properties:

1. Employee's name
2. Employee's role/profession:
    a. Manager
    b. Engineer
    c. Intern
3. Employee ID
4. Email address
5. The following, depending upon the role:
    a. Office phone number, if manager
    b. Github account, if engineer
    c. School name, if intern

The special advantage of using this app is that it allows the team organiser or user to add as many team members as they wish, including if the team requires multiple managers. At the end, the team is displayed on a html page, an example of which is shown in the image below:
